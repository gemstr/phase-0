## What does puts do?
PUTS diisplays the output to the console but RETURNs nill

##What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number without a decimal point. A floating point number means that the number has a decimal place.

## What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? Â 
Ruby will perform float or integer division depending on the type of numbers that you use(input). Ruby does not return the remainder of a divided number(if any) unless specified with the modulus (%). So basically, if theres is any floating number in your equation, ruby will output a floating number answer! And if the numbers inputted in the division equation are all whole integers, then the ouput will be whole integers!


How many hours in a year?
```
puts 365 * 24
```
How many hours in a decade?
```
puts 10 * 365 * 24 * 60
```


##Reflection

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
-All basic arithmetic output depends on the input of the number type. If any of the input numbers is a float number, then the output result will  be a float number.
##What is the difference between integers and floats?
-Integers are numbers that don't have a decimal in it. Floats are more precise and include a decimal point.
##What is the difference between integer and float division?
-(Fromo Answer above) Ruby will perform float or integer division depending on the type of numbers that you use(input). Ruby does not return the remainder of a divided number(if any) unless specified with the modulus (%). So basically, if theres is any floating number in your equation, ruby will output a floating number answer! And if the numbers inputted in the division equation are all whole integers, then the ouput will be whole integers!
##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
-Strings are groups of characters/letters in a program. They are stored in memory and can be manipulated after. They are used to store and display user input/output.
##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
-Local variables are variables that are used in specific to the related Functions it is used for.
##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
-I enjoyed this challenge as Rspec was able to catch my mistake of storing my age variable as a string and not a fixednumber.
##Also add links to the your challenge solution files so people can easily access it. There should be a link for each exercise above.
