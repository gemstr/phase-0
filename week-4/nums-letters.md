##What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number without a decimal point. A floating point number means that the number has a decimal place.

## What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? Â 
Ruby will perform float or integer division depending on the type of numbers that you use(input). Ruby does not return the remainder of a divided number(if any) unless specified with the modulus (%). So basically, if theres is any floating number in your equation, ruby will output a floating number answer! And if the numbers inputted in the division equation are all whole integers, then the ouput will be whole integers!
