Create new Github repo by going to Github.com and clicking (+) at the top and select 'create new repository'. Specify name and MIT license. After creating repo, copy url of the newly forked repository (provided by github on project page). Inside terminal, navigate to the root folder in which you would like to store the local repository. Run command: git clone [Git URL]. It will clone the git repository and track all changes
Open source means the source code of the project is open for others to copy, modify, and distribute(with some limitations). I feel open source is a great way to maintain and update code collaborativey with others who share the same interests in the project. I feel we must protect and preserve open source culture so we can have a future for affordable computing! Licensing is iportant in open source b/c it states the limitations of the copyright and credits of the creators.
In this challenge I had a good undestanding of the concepts from previous excercies and practicing push/pull/merge is helping me feel very comfortable with git.
