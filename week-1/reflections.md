## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
The most useful time management tool I learned about was the time box. I know that I have a tendency of doing things without the time in mind. My thought is that doing things as “fast as I can” is the best way of getting things done. Unfortunately when the task at hand is a large or difficult, it can feel overwhelming and desperate. If I divide my tasks into smaller time box segments that I can finish respectfully, I can accomplish more of the overall task and not get “stuck” anywhere. Time boxing will allow me to respect my mind wandering side when I take time box breaks. I expect most of my creativity and ideas come from there and an increase in productivity.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
Shell is the command line interface through which we communicate with the machine. Bash is is the command language interpreter that most Unix machines understand.
The most difficult thing is getting used to working within the command line but it becomes very apparent how robust it is.
I believe the most important commands to know are the commands for orientation and navigation (pwd, ls, cd). I also believe 'man [command]' or 'help [command]' is a very important command to know because it contains documentation about the command.

pwd -prints the current working directory

ls - lists contents of directory

mv- move files from one location to another, can also be used to rename files.

cd - change directory (~/) can be used to goto root.

../ - means the parent directory of the current directory.

touch - used to create file(s) or to set access and modification stamps. Used with 'stat'

mkdir - used to create folders. the -p option allows creation of nested folders

less - less is used to move backwards and forwards when reading a file

rmdir - used to remove a directory(s)

rm - used to remove file(s)

help - used to documentation

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
