      <h2>What is Git?</h2>
      <p>
        What is Git? Git is a command line program that is used for version control. This means with Git, you can save multiple versions of your work and go back to various versions/states of files.
      </p>
      <p>
          Using Git is like owning a bunch of USB thumb drives. The original thumbdrive that the source code/project resides is called 'master'.
          'Master' can be manipulated, but it is not advised. It is better practice to 'clone' the master to another thumbdrive so it can be worked on without interrupting the 'master' USB drive. The same concept applies to git 'braching'. After the user is done working, changes can be merged back to the master USB with file comparison. Then it is up to the user to delete the branch (throw away USB Drive) as it isn't needed anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
          Git helps users keep track of their project's file changes thru the use of commits. Everytime a user "commits" a checkpoint of the file(s) it's state is saved so it can be reverted to a specific commit point in the past. But how does Git know which files to include in it's commit? It all starts with the 'git add' command.
      </p>
      <p>
      Github is a social website that allows coders to collaborate together using Git by hosting code thru peer review. Because this code is hosted online it can be cloned to a local computer and worked on from there! One of the many benefits of hosting on Github!

<!-- *Reflection*

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
-I used all the standard html5 elements: head, body, nav, section, footer
The HTML5 tags inside the <body> tags that are the most reoccuring I believe is the
-<section>&<main> and then <h> & <p> elements
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
-When the browswer displays a page, it's elements are laid out as the .html page is read. The browswer uses top down order to display elements.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
-I learned that I can create instant template shortucts for starting certain documents such as html.
