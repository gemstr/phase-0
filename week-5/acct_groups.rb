Release 6: Reflect
What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
- Â The most difficult and interesting park of this challenge was coming up with working pseudocode solution.(paper)
Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
The more I have a 'feel' for the Ruby environnemt, my ability  to pseudocode gets better. I guess it's a matter of know what I'm capable of in Ruby sor far.
Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
- I believe simple logic is what got me a working solution.
What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
- Basically a hash. An array of arrays.
What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
I couldn't refactor.
