# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [with: John Polhill].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative uses the path relative to the file location as opposed to the absolute path.

#=======================================================================
# Reflection Section
# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# => One uses the symbol format and the other uses the hash rocket.

# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# => require_relative uses the path relative to the file location as opposed to the absolute path.

# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# => enumerable methods, while loops, etc.

#When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# => Instance variables don't need to be passed as parameters

#What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# => @@ means class variables.
